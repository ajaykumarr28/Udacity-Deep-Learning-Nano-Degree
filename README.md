# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nano-Degree

This repository contains my solutions to the projects given by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) as part of their amazing [Deep Learning Nano Degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

1. [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nano-Degree/tree/master/1%20-%20Predicting%20Bike-Sharing%20Patterns) - In this project, I built and trained my own neural network from scratch to predict the number of bike-share users on a given day.

2. [Dog-Breed Classifier](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nano-Degree/tree/master/2%20-%20Dog-Breed%20Classifier) - In this project, I learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.

3. [Generate TV Scripts](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nano-Degree/tree/master/3%20-%20Generate%20TV%20Scripts) - In this project, I generated a TV script by defining and training a recurrent neural network.

4. [Generate Faces](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nano-Degree/tree/master/4%20-%20Generate%20Faces) - In this project, I defined two adversarial networks, a generator and a discriminator, and trained them until I was able to generate realistic faces.

5. [Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nano-Degree/tree/master/5%20-%20Deploying%20a%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Model) - In this project, I built and deployed a neural network that predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review. Also, I created a simple web app that uses my deployed model.
